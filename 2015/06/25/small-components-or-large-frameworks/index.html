    <h1 class="post-title">Small components, or large frameworks?</h1>
    <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</span>
    <p>This is a hot topic these days, and the JavaScript world is definitely siding
with &quot;small, composable components&quot; over &quot;one framework that gives you
everything you probably need&quot;. However, I think there are some things to
consider that get often looked over in the debate.</p>
<p>Just to clarify: I&#39;m not sure which I side on. I have <em>years</em> of frustrations
with frameworks that make me think the small module approach is &quot;better&quot;. But,
I&#39;ve also experienced some pains when working in a component driven stack as
well.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate, or something. Either way, here&#39;s what&#39;s
been on my mind.</p>
<h3 id="frameworks-are-complex-and-that-s-bad">Frameworks are complex, and that&#39;s bad</h3>
<p>Sure. Frameworks have to solve for a lot of things, and they have to try and
provide as many features as possible to handle any scenario that you might
encounter. The point of a framework is giving you just about everything you
could need. That&#39;s a pretty big task to take on, so inherently it&#39;s going to
result in a complex system.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the thing people never mention: sometimes you need all those things, and
<strong>a large web application is going to be a inherently complex</strong>. We should
always strive to make them as simple as possible, but there is still a
limitation. The things we build sometimes have to be large and complex.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Build it with a framework</strong></p>
<p>If we are building a very large and featureful web application, using a
framework means we have all we need (allegedly, I&#39;ll admit). Learning to use the
framework is an overhead, but the documentation is usually all in one place and
usually consistent, which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Build it with a bunch of small modules</strong></p>
<p>If we are building a very large and featureful web application using a bunch of
small modules, we are <em>still</em> going to end up with a pretty damn complex
technology stack. Just because each tool in itself is small and easy to
understand doesn&#39;t mean that the collection of modules and how they interact <em>as
a whole</em> will also be simple and digestible.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be quite the opposite.</p>
<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>
<p>One benefit of a framework is the consistency. If you arent&#39;t sure how to
accomplish a particular task, chances are it has been done by another user of
the framework and you can find the answer online somewhere.</p>
<p>For modules, this is equally true. However, if the task you&#39;re trying to
accomplish involves more than just one of the modules you&#39;re using, then you
have to find an answer that involves the use of those two modules specifically,
which can be a bit less likely (unless they&#39;re very popular modules, etc).</p>
<h3 id="the-parts-of-a-whole">The parts of a whole</h3>
<p>When you&#39;re working with a framework, typically each piece of that framework has
it&#39;s own documentation. You could even think of these pieces as modules that fit
into a greater whole. That doesn&#39;t seem so bad, does it? You&#39;re essentially
doing the same with a collection of module components.</p>
<p>The difference is that the components in a framework are built with the rest of
the components in mind. They make damn sure that they will work well together,
and that&#39;s also part of the documentation. If two people are building modules in
isolation, who&#39;s to say how easily those two modules will actually work
together?</p>
<p>Sure, things like standardization and semantics can help guide this. But the
point is that frameworks typically make sure to have you covered.</p>
<h3 id="enough-rambling">Enough rambling</h3>
<p>This is something that&#39;s been on my mind. I&#39;m personally trying to make my
decision on which type of architecture I prefer. There are clear wins on either
side, but my big point is that <strong>this idea that our applications will be so much
simpler because we use a collection of simple tools is false</strong>.</p>
<p>Combining a bunch of simple tools into a large system (framework, even?) results
in complexity. The complexity of a system is better handled in the overall
architecture of the system itself, not necessarily the tools you use to build
it.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t judge a tool just because it&#39;s a framework, judge it based on the actual
overall quality of it. Complete solutions can be great, and small modules can be
great. They each have their place in the world.</p>
