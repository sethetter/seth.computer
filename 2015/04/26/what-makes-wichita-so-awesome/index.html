    <h1 class="post-title">What makes Wichita so awesome?</h1>
    <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2015</span>
    <p>Good question. I think there are a lot of people in Wichita who would argue
whether Wichita is awesome in the first place. I&#39;m here to offer a
counterpoint.</p>
<p>One of the main things I hear in point against Wichita is that there is &quot;nothing
to do here&quot; which in my mind is quite ridiculous. Every week it seems I am
finding out about more events and venues that I had never heard of before. So
many small groups in town are making things happen, and that&#39;s awesome.</p>
<p>When I hear people talk against Wichita, they often compare it to some other
place, usually coupled with plans to move to said new location. &quot;Wichita has
nothing going on, and [insert bigger city here] is just awesome!&quot;</p>
<p>This is unfair. Every city is going to have it&#39;s good qualities and it&#39;d bad
qualities. I guarantee that the possible of there being something <em>bad</em> about
wherever they plan to move to hasn&#39;t crossed their minds yet. They also do quick
work to forget about all the good things that exist about Wichita.</p>
<p><strong>What good things?</strong> - Well, let me tell you.</p>
<h5 id="awesome-things-are-happening-here-">Awesome things ARE happening here!</h5>
<p>To target the question of &quot;what is there to do in Wichita&quot; - it really doesn&#39;t
take much searching to find that awesome things are happening all over the
place.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I went on a journey to some location known as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRedBarnOutdoorMarket">Red Barn
Outdoor Market</a> in order to
try a new vegan food truck in town, <a href="http://www.kindkravings.com/">Kind
Kravings</a>. I had no idea what I was getting myself
into.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a gathering of literally <em>thousands</em> of people all to form a
bi-annual outdoor market for individuals who make and sell just about anything
you can imagine -- furniture, signs, jewelry, food, and many other forms of art.
There were musicians, entertainers, and of course a giant crowd enjoying the
event to the fullest.</p>
<p>The fact that I can still stumble upon awesome things like this that I never
knew existed around here is awesome. People are starting events like this all
the time, so there is always some new awesome things to check out.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Groups like <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article4167320.html">MakeICT</a>
are <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/carrie-rengers/article14699531.html">creating
spaces</a>
for individuals to come and make whatever it is they want.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Arts organizations such as <a href="http://www.harvesterarts.com/">Harvester Arts</a>,
<a href="http://www.fischhaus.com/">Fisch Haus</a> and all of the <a href="http://commerceartsdistrict.com/">Commerce Street Arts
District</a> are putting on awesome events to
showcase local talent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grassroots media publications such as <a href="http://f5paper.com/">F5</a> and
<a href="http://midwestdigest.ninja">Midwest Digest</a> are doing their part to
spread the word of awesome around Wichita.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://twitter.com/startupwichita">Startup Wichita</a> exists to bring
together entrepreneurs in the area to assist each other in creating new
local businesses, and to put on events like <a href="http://startupweekend.org">Startup
Weekend</a> (we&#39;ve had 5 of them now).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The list goes on.</em></p>
<p>All of these things are signs that Wichita is incredibly active. People
are making things happen, and you can be a part of them all.</p>
<h5 id="massively-supportive-community">Massively supportive community</h5>
<p>So things are happening here, we can see evidence of that. But what
about <em>your</em> idea? What about what <em>you</em> want to see happen around here?</p>
<p>The thing to remember is that most of these communities, locations and
events are started by small groups of people here in Wichita, sometimes
even just one individual.</p>
<p>It takes very little effort to get something going here, and with a
large population of people looking for more things to do, it&#39;s easy to
make yourself known and to draw a crowd.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter <em>who</em> you are in Wichita. <strong>You can make something
happen</strong>, no matter what it is. There exists a community here for your
particular niche, and they are ready and willing (even excited) to
support you in your endeavor. Regardless of the circle, I&#39;ve witnessed
almost zero elitism here. That in itself is incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>Wichita has one of the most supportive communities I&#39;ve ever seen, and
that community just happens to be <strong>packed</strong> with incredibly talented
and creative individuals. Best part of all? They&#39;re all awesome, humble
people, who would gladly sit down, have a beer with you, and offer
whatever advice and support that they can.</p>
<p>That&#39;s something you typically don&#39;t see in larger communities, and a
big part of why I am proud to call Wichita my home town.</p>
<h5 id="be-the-change-you-want-to-see">Be the change you want to see</h5>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard this phrase before. The idea behind it is that
instead of complaining about things that are <em>wrong</em> around you it&#39;s
more effective to set the example and spread the influence that you want
to see around you.</p>
<p>This is advice that I try to follow in my life, all throughout my
interactions with individuals. But in the context of Wichita this
statement is even more powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Wichita is a blank slate, begging to be morphed it something even more
awesome than it already is.</strong></p>
<p>The amazing communities that exist here are nearly all grassroots
efforts that have ended up impacting the community in a positive way.
They&#39;re all supportive of others who are trying to do the same.</p>
<p>Because of this combination just about <em>anyone</em> can make an impact here.
Is there something about Wichita you don&#39;t like? Something you think is
missing? <strong>Then make it happen</strong>. Plenty of other individuals have done
just that. What&#39;s stopping you?</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to make a big splash in much larger communities. Here in
Wichita we are a tight-knit group who all share a common interest in
making our hometown awesome. It&#39;s an incredibly good feeling to do so,
and there is no place on Earth where it&#39;s more possible.</p>
<p>So - stop complaining, and go out there and make something awesome
happen. All it takes is trying, and you&#39;ll see the support of our great
community come out of nowhere to help you along your journey.</p>
<p><strong>That is why I love Wichita. That is why Wichita is awesome.</strong></p>
