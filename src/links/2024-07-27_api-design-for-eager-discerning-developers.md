API design is tricky, and often overlooked. But the fact is, as software developers, we're all designing interfaces on a regular basis.

Whether it's the signature of a function, the inputs to a CLI utility, or the inputs to an API endpoint, these things all benefit from more thoughtful interface design.

Any time spent investing in this skill is time well spent.
