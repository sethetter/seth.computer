If you're not familiar with Open Wichita, my first suggestion would be to check
out our website at [openwichita.com](http://openwichita.com). In a nutshell,
Open Wichita is a *civic hacking* initiative.

It is a group of volunteers that aim to improve the city and community around
them using technology. This can happen in many different ways, including
[improving our public transit digital tooling](public-transit), [rebooting our
local observatory's exhibits and online presence](observatory), and even
[creating online tools to improve voter involvement](voter-turnout).  For a full
list of our current projects, check out [the projects page](projects).

## Why is this important?

Wichita has long been a little behind the curve when it comes to technology. I
don't like admitting this, because I am a *huge* fan of our city and want us to
be the best we possibly can. For that same reason though, we have to admit our
faults and focus on improving them.

One way of doing this is to learn from the efforts and successes of other
cities. A trend we see happening nationally is this idea of civic hacking. These
are grassroots efforts powered by volunteers who care about their city.

It's fed by local government collaboration, including an effort to open up
public datasets that developers, designers and other individuals can use to
create new digital services that add value to the city.

They can also use this open data for analysis to produce reports and
visualizations that can better inform decisions around policy making, budgets,
and other efforts driven by local government and politics.

Take a look at a similar effort in Chicago called [Smart Chicago](smart-chicago)
which has turned into a powerful force for change in their city. This was
possible because of the bottom-up approach to solving problems that they took
on. The *citizens* and *volunteers* drove the projects, and the city was there
to support and collaborate where necessary.

## Civic Involvement

This has been a hot topic in Wichita recently. We want more people in the city
to be a part of making it better. Personally I feel like I see this all over the
place. People who care and are putting in time to create things to make Wichita
a better place. Whether that is a business, a community, or a piece of artwork.
We all live here together and want it to be the best place it can be.

What I want to see is more recognition for these efforts. By allowing the
citizens to be the driving force, backed up by local government and
organizations, we too can experience the positive change that such a bottom-up
approach can produce for a city.

One step that can be taken on the city's part to make this happen is signing an
[Open Data Policy](open-data-cio) like [the one the federal government has
implemented](federal-open-data-policy) into legislation. This states the city's
commitment to providing publicly collected data to the citizenship freely and
openly.

When you put this data into the hands of the public, amazing things can happen.
Look at the [examples listed on the Open Wichita website](open-wichita-about)
for specific case studies of these effects. We need this here in Wichita,
whether we realize it or not. There is nothing but good that can come from it,
and we should pursue it.

Besides civic involvement, this would also address another issue that we face in
Wichita.

## Tech-centered culture

There has been a lot of talk lately in Wichita about creating a more
"innovative" environment. That we used to be such an "entrepreneurial" town but
we've lost that spirit in more recent years. What one thing is at the center of
innovation in today's world? -- *Technology*.

Efforts such as civic hacking and an open data policy are tech-focused in their
very nature. With the city signing an open data policy into legislation, that
shows that we care about and are focused on technology. It shows that we're
trying to improve our tech culture here, and creates more of a platform for it
to flourish.

Efforts like this allow developers and other tech-focused individuals to
connect, collaborate, create and invent new things. They can create new products
that lead to more tech companies in town. Our economy needs technology right now
just as much as our local government efforts need it.

*There's a lot of work to be done, but it takes creating the foundation first.*

With the city's support, and the support of other local organizations, we can
create a community that is focused on technology and innovation for the greater
good. By supporting *civic* hacking efforts we create pride in our community,
and a sense that we can *all* contribute to making Wichita a better place.

*Want to retain talent? Give them some ownership. Give them a reason to have
pride in their community.* These efforts can do just that.

## What next?

Well, I want to see an open data policy signed into legislation. Then I'd like
to see efforts to get federal and foundation support for the city government to
implement these open data practices. Then we just need more and more people to
get involved in this movement and to care about their city.

All of these pieces falling into place will allow *citizens* to be directly
involved in the creation of a city they are proud of and care about. It takes
some of the burden of solving the city's problems away from just government and
politics.

*Let us be a driving force, and we will create a place that everyone can be
proud of.*
