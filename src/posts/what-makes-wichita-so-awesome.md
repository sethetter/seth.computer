Good question. I think there are a lot of people in Wichita who would argue
whether Wichita is awesome in the first place. I'm here to offer a
counterpoint.

One of the main things I hear in point against Wichita is that there is "nothing
to do here" which in my mind is quite ridiculous. Every week it seems I am
finding out about more events and venues that I had never heard of before. So
many small groups in town are making things happen, and that's awesome.

When I hear people talk against Wichita, they often compare it to some other
place, usually coupled with plans to move to said new location. "Wichita has
nothing going on, and [insert bigger city here] is just awesome!"

This is unfair. Every city is going to have it's good qualities and it'd bad
qualities. I guarantee that the possible of there being something *bad* about
wherever they plan to move to hasn't crossed their minds yet. They also do quick
work to forget about all the good things that exist about Wichita.

**What good things?** - Well, let me tell you.


##### Awesome things ARE happening here!

To target the question of "what is there to do in Wichita" - it really doesn't
take much searching to find that awesome things are happening all over the
place.

Just yesterday I went on a journey to some location known as the [Red Barn
Outdoor Market](https://www.facebook.com/TheRedBarnOutdoorMarket) in order to
try a new vegan food truck in town, [Kind
Kravings](http://www.kindkravings.com/). I had no idea what I was getting myself
into.

It turned out to be a gathering of literally *thousands* of people all to form a
bi-annual outdoor market for individuals who make and sell just about anything
you can imagine -- furniture, signs, jewelry, food, and many other forms of art.
There were musicians, entertainers, and of course a giant crowd enjoying the
event to the fullest.

The fact that I can still stumble upon awesome things like this that I never
knew existed around here is awesome. People are starting events like this all
the time, so there is always some new awesome things to check out.

* Groups like [MakeICT](http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article4167320.html)
are [creating
spaces](http://www.kansas.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/carrie-rengers/article14699531.html)
for individuals to come and make whatever it is they want.

* Arts organizations such as [Harvester Arts](http://www.harvesterarts.com/),
[Fisch Haus](http://www.fischhaus.com/) and all of the [Commerce Street Arts
District](http://commerceartsdistrict.com/) are putting on awesome events to
showcase local talent.

* Grassroots media publications such as [F5](http://f5paper.com/) and
[Midwest Digest](http://midwestdigest.ninja) are doing their part to
spread the word of awesome around Wichita.

* [Startup Wichita](http://twitter.com/startupwichita) exists to bring
together entrepreneurs in the area to assist each other in creating new
local businesses, and to put on events like [Startup
Weekend](http://startupweekend.org) (we've had 5 of them now).

*The list goes on.*

All of these things are signs that Wichita is incredibly active. People
are making things happen, and you can be a part of them all.

##### Massively supportive community

So things are happening here, we can see evidence of that. But what
about *your* idea? What about what *you* want to see happen around here?

The thing to remember is that most of these communities, locations and
events are started by small groups of people here in Wichita, sometimes
even just one individual.

It takes very little effort to get something going here, and with a
large population of people looking for more things to do, it's easy to
make yourself known and to draw a crowd.

It doesn't matter *who* you are in Wichita. **You can make something
happen**, no matter what it is. There exists a community here for your
particular niche, and they are ready and willing (even excited) to
support you in your endeavor. Regardless of the circle, I've witnessed
almost zero elitism here. That in itself is incredibly valuable.

Wichita has one of the most supportive communities I've ever seen, and
that community just happens to be **packed** with incredibly talented
and creative individuals. Best part of all? They're all awesome, humble
people, who would gladly sit down, have a beer with you, and offer
whatever advice and support that they can.

That's something you typically don't see in larger communities, and a
big part of why I am proud to call Wichita my home town.

##### Be the change you want to see

I'm sure you've heard this phrase before. The idea behind it is that
instead of complaining about things that are *wrong* around you it's
more effective to set the example and spread the influence that you want
to see around you.

This is advice that I try to follow in my life, all throughout my
interactions with individuals. But in the context of Wichita this
statement is even more powerful.

**Wichita is a blank slate, begging to be morphed it something even more
awesome than it already is.**

The amazing communities that exist here are nearly all grassroots
efforts that have ended up impacting the community in a positive way.
They're all supportive of others who are trying to do the same.

Because of this combination just about *anyone* can make an impact here.
Is there something about Wichita you don't like? Something you think is
missing? **Then make it happen**. Plenty of other individuals have done
just that. What's stopping you?

It's hard to make a big splash in much larger communities. Here in
Wichita we are a tight-knit group who all share a common interest in
making our hometown awesome. It's an incredibly good feeling to do so,
and there is no place on Earth where it's more possible.

So - stop complaining, and go out there and make something awesome
happen. All it takes is trying, and you'll see the support of our great
community come out of nowhere to help you along your journey.

**That is why I love Wichita. That is why Wichita is awesome.**
