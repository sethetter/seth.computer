title: I'm going to work for The OpenGov Foundation!
---

Ever since I have been a developer and have known about the wonderful world of
open source software I have dreamed of being able to contribute to that
ecosystem full time. Well, I'm finally get that opportunity. Not only am I
getting the chance to work on open source full time, the projects that I will be
working on are civically focused and support the ideas of open and transparent
government, something I'm very passionate about.

As of this coming Monday, November 16th, I will be employed with [The OpenGov
Foundation](http://opengovfoundation.org) as a Senior Application Developer! I
can't begin to express how excited and honored I am to have this opportunity.
It's always been of utmost importance to me to know that the time I spend
working goes towards bettering the world around me in some way, and now I can be
more sure of that than I ever have been before.

I've very much enjoyed my time at [BalancedComp](http://balancedcomp.com), and
I'll miss every single one of the team members there greatly. I'm thankful for
everything I've learned there, and the incredibly fun times we've had in the
office. Board game breaks are not something I will be able to have at most
places of employment, haha.

Though, when a chance like this came along, I certainly couldn't ignore it. I'm
looking forward to contributing to the amazing work that the team at OpenGov
has started and to push our nation's legislative processes forward into the
twenty-first century.

*Here's to creating a more open and accessible government. I can't wait to get
started*
