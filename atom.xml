    <h1 class="post-title">I switched to Metalsmith, for no good reason</h1>
    <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2015</span>
    <p>I decided, over the last couple days, to learn a bit about
<a href="http://metalsmith.io">Metalsmith</a>. It&#39;s a static content generator for node.js.
I&#39;ve been happy with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, thoroughly so. But I&#39;m
definitely more of a JavaScript guy, so I wanted to check out what Metalsmith
had to offer.</p>
<h2 id="i-admit-it">I admit it</h2>
<p>This was essentially pointless. I had a website that already functioned the way
I wanted it to. Namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hosted on GitHub</li>
<li>Dynamically generated static content</li>
<li>Written in markdown</li>
</ol>
<p>Jekyll does a fantastic job at that. Also, considering I wanted to host on
GitHub, choosing jekyll makes that <em>even easier</em> since it&#39;s supported. With
Metalsmith I had to <a href="https://github.com/sethetter/sethetter.com/blob/master/bin/deploy">add a small
step</a> to
commit the generated content by itself into the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>
<p>Not a big deal, but still.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I&#39;m a bit of a purist. At least in situations where it isn&#39;t
detrimental. I wanted to learn about Metalsmith, so I rebuilt my website with
it. BIG DEAL!</p>
<p>Anyways..</p>
<h2 id="metalsmith-is-awesome-">Metalsmith is awesome!</h2>
<p>Unlike Jekyll, Metalsmith is a base system that takes files from a <code>src/</code>
directory and outputs them to a destination folder. It passes these files
through a series of middleware &quot;plugins&quot; that perform different operations on
them. This makes Metalsmith much more flexible than Jekyll.</p>
<p>It just so happens that Jekyll already did what I needed. But again, that&#39;s
beside the point.</p>
<p>It goes something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">Metalsmith(__dirname)
.use(markdown())
.use(collections({
  posts: { sortBy: &#39;date&#39; }
})
.use(layouts({
  engine: &#39;handlebars&#39;,
  directory: &#39;./layouts&#39;
})
.build(function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
});
</code></pre>
<p>Each of the functions in the <code>use</code> statements are a plugin. Plugins are super
easy. They just have to be a function that accepts <code>files</code>, <code>metalsmith</code>, and
<code>next</code>. You do some stuff with the files, attach information to the <code>metalsmith</code>
instance, or whatever else you want to do, then call <code>next()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">Metalsmith(__dirname)
.use(function(files, metalsmith, next) {
  addLotsOfCurseWords(files);
  metalsmith.metadata().familyFriendly = false;

  next();
});
</code></pre>
<p>There are a bunch of metalsmith plugins already created too. I didn&#39;t have to
write anything new to accomplish what I wanted, which again, was a jekyll
replacement.</p>
<h2 id="did-i-waste-my-time-">Did I waste my time?</h2>
<p>I felt like I was at first, because surely there was another project that I
could have used to learn metalsmith with, but I chose this one. All in all, I
just wanted to switch to my site being generated by node instead of ruby,
whether that&#39;s petty and pointless or not, damnit, I did it.</p>
<p>It was fun though! I&#39;ve really enjoyed working with metalsmith and plan to use
it for static sites in the future. It can be much more than that, so I&#39;m happy
to have this new tool under my belt.</p>
<h2 id="the-sooooooource">The sooooooource</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/sethetter/sethetter.com">view the source on github</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask any questions. I&#39;m not a metalsmith expert, by any means, but
I learned a bit.</p>
<p>THE END</p>

    <h1 class="post-title">Bridging Wichita&#39;s communities</h1>
    <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2015</span>
    <p>It&#39;s been said on numerous occasions that there are too many uncoordinated
efforts in Wichita. That we have several community leaders working to create
change and improve the city but that efforts are being duplicated. &quot;We need to
coordinate and collaborate&quot; is what is often said, but the question remains:</p>
<h3 id="how-exactly-">How, exactly?</h3>
<p>Recently I was part of a meeting with several individuals involved in various
community focused organizations here in town. The subject of the meeting was
&quot;what is everyone doing and how can we collaborate&quot;. Overall I call it a
productive meeting. I met individuals I had not known before and learned about
organizations and efforts that exist here.</p>
<p>However, it was far from obvious how we proceed with the set mission for that
meeting. We settled on making sure we share contact information and
organizational involvement, mostly so if an opportunity for two organizations to
collaborate presents itself, we have the means to do so. I think this was a
valid way to conclude the meeting.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that there was some desire to create some kind of giant
coordinated effort between all organizations represented at the meeting. <strong>I
have no idea how that would have been possible</strong>. Given that, simply creating
more awareness seemed like a productive conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="but-">But..</h3>
<p>I brought up briefly at the meeting that having a way to spread the word about
the different efforts in Wichita to our own organization&#39;s members would be a
great way to encourage cross-involvement within our memberships.</p>
<p><em>How do we go about that?</em></p>
<p>There&#39;s a number of ways that would be effective. One, however, struck me today.</p>
<p><strong>What if there was a generalized event that individuals from every one of these
various diverse organizations had a place in? An event where any one of these
people had a voice to share their ideas?</strong></p>
<p>This would allow members from any walks of life and background and interest in
Wichita to attend the same meeting, hear from each other, and share their
passions, interests, ideas, etc. It would increase awareness, create collisions,
and boost efforts. Overall, it&#39;d be incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, Kevin Falting, was recently inspired by the <a href="ignite-boulder">Ignite
Boulder</a> speaking event. At this event, any person can get up
and give a 5 minute talk on a subject or idea of their choice. <strong>It must be an
idea, not just promotion. Teach, don&#39;t preach is the motto.</strong> But, it is
inclusive to anyone wanting to spread an idea, and it&#39;s been an incredible part
of the Boulder community.</p>
<h3 id="let-s-do-it-here-">Let&#39;s do it here!</h3>
<p>Kevin decided to take the reins and make this happen for Wichita. So he created
<a href="http://wichitalks.com">Wichitalks</a>. I think this event has a ton of potential
to bolster our community and spread ideas and efforts to places and people we
haven&#39;t yet thought of.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it&#39;s going to be very entertaining. The talks are meant to be
educational, inspirational, motivating, inspiring and entertaining. <strong>It&#39;s open
to anyone who wants to share their thoughts or ideas.</strong> I encourage you to
attend, and if you feel so inclined, to speak.</p>
<p><strong>The first occurrence will be on Jan 29, 2015, 6:30p at The Labor Party in Old
Town. Come check it out.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wichitalks.com">Check out the website</a> for more information or to sign
up as a speaker. This is definitely an event worth attending.</p>

    <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2015</span>
    <p>If you&#39;re not familiar with Open Wichita, my first suggestion would be to check
out our website at <a href="http://openwichita.com">openwichita.com</a>. In a nutshell,
Open Wichita is a <em>civic hacking</em> initiative.</p>
<p>It is a group of volunteers that aim to improve the city and community around
them using technology. This can happen in many different ways, including
<a href="public-transit">improving our public transit digital tooling</a>, <a href="observatory">rebooting our
local observatory&#39;s exhibits and online presence</a>, and even
<a href="voter-turnout">creating online tools to improve voter involvement</a>.  For a full
list of our current projects, check out <a href="projects">the projects page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h2>
<p>Wichita has long been a little behind the curve when it comes to technology. I
don&#39;t like admitting this, because I am a <em>huge</em> fan of our city and want us to
be the best we possibly can. For that same reason though, we have to admit our
faults and focus on improving them.</p>
<p>One way of doing this is to learn from the efforts and successes of other
cities. A trend we see happening nationally is this idea of civic hacking. These
are grassroots efforts powered by volunteers who care about their city.</p>
<p>It&#39;s fed by local government collaboration, including an effort to open up
public datasets that developers, designers and other individuals can use to
create new digital services that add value to the city.</p>
<p>They can also use this open data for analysis to produce reports and
visualizations that can better inform decisions around policy making, budgets,
and other efforts driven by local government and politics.</p>
<p>Take a look at a similar effort in Chicago called <a href="smart-chicago">Smart Chicago</a>
which has turned into a powerful force for change in their city. This was
possible because of the bottom-up approach to solving problems that they took
on. The <em>citizens</em> and <em>volunteers</em> drove the projects, and the city was there
to support and collaborate where necessary.</p>
<h2 id="civic-involvement">Civic Involvement</h2>
<p>This has been a hot topic in Wichita recently. We want more people in the city
to be a part of making it better. Personally I feel like I see this all over the
place. People who care and are putting in time to create things to make Wichita
a better place. Whether that is a business, a community, or a piece of artwork.
We all live here together and want it to be the best place it can be.</p>
<p>What I want to see is more recognition for these efforts. By allowing the
citizens to be the driving force, backed up by local government and
organizations, we too can experience the positive change that such a bottom-up
approach can produce for a city.</p>
<p>One step that can be taken on the city&#39;s part to make this happen is signing an
<a href="open-data-cio">Open Data Policy</a> like <a href="federal-open-data-policy">the one the federal government has
implemented</a> into legislation. This states the city&#39;s
commitment to providing publicly collected data to the citizenship freely and
openly.</p>
<p>When you put this data into the hands of the public, amazing things can happen.
Look at the <a href="open-wichita-about">examples listed on the Open Wichita website</a>
for specific case studies of these effects. We need this here in Wichita,
whether we realize it or not. There is nothing but good that can come from it,
and we should pursue it.</p>
<p>Besides civic involvement, this would also address another issue that we face in
Wichita.</p>
<h2 id="tech-centered-culture">Tech-centered culture</h2>
<p>There has been a lot of talk lately in Wichita about creating a more
&quot;innovative&quot; environment. That we used to be such an &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; town but
we&#39;ve lost that spirit in more recent years. What one thing is at the center of
innovation in today&#39;s world? -- <em>Technology</em>.</p>
<p>Efforts such as civic hacking and an open data policy are tech-focused in their
very nature. With the city signing an open data policy into legislation, that
shows that we care about and are focused on technology. It shows that we&#39;re
trying to improve our tech culture here, and creates more of a platform for it
to flourish.</p>
<p>Efforts like this allow developers and other tech-focused individuals to
connect, collaborate, create and invent new things. They can create new products
that lead to more tech companies in town. Our economy needs technology right now
just as much as our local government efforts need it.</p>
<p><em>There&#39;s a lot of work to be done, but it takes creating the foundation first.</em></p>
<p>With the city&#39;s support, and the support of other local organizations, we can
create a community that is focused on technology and innovation for the greater
good. By supporting <em>civic</em> hacking efforts we create pride in our community,
and a sense that we can <em>all</em> contribute to making Wichita a better place.</p>
<p><em>Want to retain talent? Give them some ownership. Give them a reason to have
pride in their community.</em> These efforts can do just that.</p>
<h2 id="what-next-">What next?</h2>
<p>Well, I want to see an open data policy signed into legislation. Then I&#39;d like
to see efforts to get federal and foundation support for the city government to
implement these open data practices. Then we just need more and more people to
get involved in this movement and to care about their city.</p>
<p>All of these pieces falling into place will allow <em>citizens</em> to be directly
involved in the creation of a city they are proud of and care about. It takes
some of the burden of solving the city&#39;s problems away from just government and
politics.</p>
<p><em>Let us be a driving force, and we will create a place that everyone can be
proud of.</em></p>

    <span class="post-date">14 Nov 2015</span>
    <p>Ever since I have been a developer and have known about the wonderful world of
open source software I have dreamed of being able to contribute to that
ecosystem full time. Well, I&#39;m finally get that opportunity. Not only am I
getting the chance to work on open source full time, the projects that I will be
working on are civically focused and support the ideas of open and transparent
government, something I&#39;m very passionate about.</p>
<p>As of this coming Monday, November 16th, I will be employed with <a href="http://opengovfoundation.org">The OpenGov
Foundation</a> as a Senior Application Developer! I
can&#39;t begin to express how excited and honored I am to have this opportunity.
It&#39;s always been of utmost importance to me to know that the time I spend
working goes towards bettering the world around me in some way, and now I can be
more sure of that than I ever have been before.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve very much enjoyed my time at <a href="http://balancedcomp.com">BalancedComp</a>, and
I&#39;ll miss every single one of the team members there greatly. I&#39;m thankful for
everything I&#39;ve learned there, and the incredibly fun times we&#39;ve had in the
office. Board game breaks are not something I will be able to have at most
places of employment, haha.</p>
<p>Though, when a chance like this came along, I certainly couldn&#39;t ignore it. I&#39;m
looking forward to contributing to the amazing work that the team at OpenGov
has started and to push our nation&#39;s legislative processes forward into the
twenty-first century.</p>
<p><em>Here&#39;s to creating a more open and accessible government. I can&#39;t wait to get
started</em></p>

    <h1 class="post-title">How I made this site with Jekyll and GitHub</h1>
    <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2015</span>
    <p>So, this site is made with a system called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It&#39;s
a static site generator written in Ruby. It&#39;s dead simple to use, and with the
help of GitHub, can be really quick and easy to deploy as well.</p>
<p>On top of all that, you get to write your site content in
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>! Can&#39;t beat that.</p>
<h2 id="getting-jekyll">Getting Jekyll</h2>
<p>First you need Ruby installed, I don&#39;t want to go too far into this but if you
don&#39;t have it, I recommend using <a href="https://rvm.io/">rvm</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re up and running with Ruby, next you need to install Jekyll.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ gem install jekyll
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can create your new site! The Jekyll command line tool let&#39;s you
generate a new Jekyll site with the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ jekyll new your-site-name
</code></pre>
<p>As an alternative, you can go find a cool Jekyll theme (like I did - the
<a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon theme</a>) and start with that. In my case
I just forked the repo, cloned it down, and made it my own. The directory
structure is already set up to work like a Jekyll site should.</p>
<h2 id="local-development">Local development</h2>
<p>Since developing directly on a live server is not usually a good idea, you might
want to know how to serve your Jekyll site locally.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ jekyll s
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;s&quot; is short for &quot;serve&quot;. Makes sense, right? Cool.</p>
<p>Now you can navigate to <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a> and see your awesome statically
generated site. But how exactly is this working? It&#39;s pretty simple, really.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-all-static-files">It&#39;s all static files</h2>
<p>All Jekyll does is take your layout files and your markdown for pages and posts
and then turn them into static HTML files. It compiles this all into a folder
called <code>_site/</code> and then launches a file server on your system.</p>
<p>Some benefits of this are that it&#39;s crazy fast, no server side logic to deal
with, just send along the files.</p>
<p>For making your layouts more complex, there is an <code>_includes/</code> folder that you
can use to hold HTML fragments that you might reuse in multiple places. You can
also define different layouts in the <code>_layouts/</code> folder for different page
types, like pages vs posts.</p>
<p>Lastly, <code>index.html</code> is going to be the home page for your site. Again, makes
sense.</p>
<h2 id="site-content">Site content</h2>
<p>All of the site content is done is markdown. You can use HTML optionally, but
why would you? All of your blog posts and page content will be automagically
compiled into your layouts based on a couple things.</p>
<h3 id="blog-posts">Blog posts</h3>
<p>All your blog posts will go into a <code>_posts/</code> folder. The naming convention is
<code>YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.md</code>. Jekyll, when rendering your site, will loop
through all of these and create a list of them on your home page, and create an
individual post view page for each as well.</p>
<p>Any time you create a new post, you simply add the file to the posts folder with
your content in markdown, and some basic information headers, re-render your
site, and you&#39;re good to go.</p>
<p>To build your site and generate the static files that you can host wherever you
like, use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ jekyll b
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>b</code> is short for build. You could also write <code>jekyll build</code>. Once you&#39;ve
done this your site will be ready and available in <code>_site/</code>. You could then take
these files, put them up on any web server, and your site is ready!</p>
<h2 id="hosting-on-github-pages">Hosting on GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Even easier than hosting static files on a web server is hosting this site on
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
Start by creating a repo for your site on your GitHub account.</p>
<p>You will want to have your primary git branch for this site as <code>gh-pages</code>
instead of <code>master</code> like you normally would. If you go to the &quot;Settings&quot; in your
GitHub repo, then &quot;Branches&quot;, you will see a place to change the &quot;Default
branch&quot; to something of your choosing.</p>
<p>Make sure to create a gh-pages branch locally and then push to it on GitHub:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ git push origin gh-pages
</code></pre>
<p>You can use Jekyll normally and when you push to this new repo, it will build it
and make it available at <a href="https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name">https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name</a>.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-custom-domain">Setting up custom domain</h2>
<p>You have a site deployed using GitHub pages and Jekyll! Now you might want to
point a custom domain at it so you have something a little friendlier.</p>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll want to do is create a file in the root directory of
your repo called CNAME. This file should only contain the custom domain you are
going to use, without the protocol. Mine liikes like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sethetter.com
</code></pre>
<p>Then you&#39;ll need to set a couple A records in your zone file for your domain.
The IP addresses to point to are 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154. For more
info on this, check out <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">Setting up a custom domain with GitHub
Pages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="themes-">Themes?</h2>
<p>Check out <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">jekyllthemes.org</a>, or just google for
<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jekyll+themes">Jekkyl Themes</a>. There&#39;s a ton out there.
This one is built using the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon</a> theme.</p>
<h2 id="that-s-it-">That&#39;s it!</h2>
<p>Go have fun :)</p>

    <h1 class="post-title">Small components, or large frameworks?</h1>
    <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</span>
    <p>This is a hot topic these days, and the JavaScript world is definitely siding
with &quot;small, composable components&quot; over &quot;one framework that gives you
everything you probably need&quot;. However, I think there are some things to
consider that get often looked over in the debate.</p>
<p>Just to clarify: I&#39;m not sure which I side on. I have <em>years</em> of frustrations
with frameworks that make me think the small module approach is &quot;better&quot;. But,
I&#39;ve also experienced some pains when working in a component driven stack as
well.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate, or something. Either way, here&#39;s what&#39;s
been on my mind.</p>
<h3 id="frameworks-are-complex-and-that-s-bad">Frameworks are complex, and that&#39;s bad</h3>
<p>Sure. Frameworks have to solve for a lot of things, and they have to try and
provide as many features as possible to handle any scenario that you might
encounter. The point of a framework is giving you just about everything you
could need. That&#39;s a pretty big task to take on, so inherently it&#39;s going to
result in a complex system.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the thing people never mention: sometimes you need all those things, and
<strong>a large web application is going to be a inherently complex</strong>. We should
always strive to make them as simple as possible, but there is still a
limitation. The things we build sometimes have to be large and complex.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Build it with a framework</strong></p>
<p>If we are building a very large and featureful web application, using a
framework means we have all we need (allegedly, I&#39;ll admit). Learning to use the
framework is an overhead, but the documentation is usually all in one place and
usually consistent, which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Build it with a bunch of small modules</strong></p>
<p>If we are building a very large and featureful web application using a bunch of
small modules, we are <em>still</em> going to end up with a pretty damn complex
technology stack. Just because each tool in itself is small and easy to
understand doesn&#39;t mean that the collection of modules and how they interact <em>as
a whole</em> will also be simple and digestible.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be quite the opposite.</p>
<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>
<p>One benefit of a framework is the consistency. If you arent&#39;t sure how to
accomplish a particular task, chances are it has been done by another user of
the framework and you can find the answer online somewhere.</p>
<p>For modules, this is equally true. However, if the task you&#39;re trying to
accomplish involves more than just one of the modules you&#39;re using, then you
have to find an answer that involves the use of those two modules specifically,
which can be a bit less likely (unless they&#39;re very popular modules, etc).</p>
<h3 id="the-parts-of-a-whole">The parts of a whole</h3>
<p>When you&#39;re working with a framework, typically each piece of that framework has
it&#39;s own documentation. You could even think of these pieces as modules that fit
into a greater whole. That doesn&#39;t seem so bad, does it? You&#39;re essentially
doing the same with a collection of module components.</p>
<p>The difference is that the components in a framework are built with the rest of
the components in mind. They make damn sure that they will work well together,
and that&#39;s also part of the documentation. If two people are building modules in
isolation, who&#39;s to say how easily those two modules will actually work
together?</p>
<p>Sure, things like standardization and semantics can help guide this. But the
point is that frameworks typically make sure to have you covered.</p>
<h3 id="enough-rambling">Enough rambling</h3>
<p>This is something that&#39;s been on my mind. I&#39;m personally trying to make my
decision on which type of architecture I prefer. There are clear wins on either
side, but my big point is that <strong>this idea that our applications will be so much
simpler because we use a collection of simple tools is false</strong>.</p>
<p>Combining a bunch of simple tools into a large system (framework, even?) results
in complexity. The complexity of a system is better handled in the overall
architecture of the system itself, not necessarily the tools you use to build
it.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t judge a tool just because it&#39;s a framework, judge it based on the actual
overall quality of it. Complete solutions can be great, and small modules can be
great. They each have their place in the world.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title">What makes Wichita so awesome?</h1>
    <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2015</span>
    <p>Good question. I think there are a lot of people in Wichita who would argue
whether Wichita is awesome in the first place. I&#39;m here to offer a
counterpoint.</p>
<p>One of the main things I hear in point against Wichita is that there is &quot;nothing
to do here&quot; which in my mind is quite ridiculous. Every week it seems I am
finding out about more events and venues that I had never heard of before. So
many small groups in town are making things happen, and that&#39;s awesome.</p>
<p>When I hear people talk against Wichita, they often compare it to some other
place, usually coupled with plans to move to said new location. &quot;Wichita has
nothing going on, and [insert bigger city here] is just awesome!&quot;</p>
<p>This is unfair. Every city is going to have it&#39;s good qualities and it&#39;d bad
qualities. I guarantee that the possible of there being something <em>bad</em> about
wherever they plan to move to hasn&#39;t crossed their minds yet. They also do quick
work to forget about all the good things that exist about Wichita.</p>
<p><strong>What good things?</strong> - Well, let me tell you.</p>
<h5 id="awesome-things-are-happening-here-">Awesome things ARE happening here!</h5>
<p>To target the question of &quot;what is there to do in Wichita&quot; - it really doesn&#39;t
take much searching to find that awesome things are happening all over the
place.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I went on a journey to some location known as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRedBarnOutdoorMarket">Red Barn
Outdoor Market</a> in order to
try a new vegan food truck in town, <a href="http://www.kindkravings.com/">Kind
Kravings</a>. I had no idea what I was getting myself
into.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a gathering of literally <em>thousands</em> of people all to form a
bi-annual outdoor market for individuals who make and sell just about anything
you can imagine -- furniture, signs, jewelry, food, and many other forms of art.
There were musicians, entertainers, and of course a giant crowd enjoying the
event to the fullest.</p>
<p>The fact that I can still stumble upon awesome things like this that I never
knew existed around here is awesome. People are starting events like this all
the time, so there is always some new awesome things to check out.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Groups like <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article4167320.html">MakeICT</a>
are <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/carrie-rengers/article14699531.html">creating
spaces</a>
for individuals to come and make whatever it is they want.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Arts organizations such as <a href="http://www.harvesterarts.com/">Harvester Arts</a>,
<a href="http://www.fischhaus.com/">Fisch Haus</a> and all of the <a href="http://commerceartsdistrict.com/">Commerce Street Arts
District</a> are putting on awesome events to
showcase local talent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grassroots media publications such as <a href="http://f5paper.com/">F5</a> and
<a href="http://midwestdigest.ninja">Midwest Digest</a> are doing their part to
spread the word of awesome around Wichita.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://twitter.com/startupwichita">Startup Wichita</a> exists to bring
together entrepreneurs in the area to assist each other in creating new
local businesses, and to put on events like <a href="http://startupweekend.org">Startup
Weekend</a> (we&#39;ve had 5 of them now).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The list goes on.</em></p>
<p>All of these things are signs that Wichita is incredibly active. People
are making things happen, and you can be a part of them all.</p>
<h5 id="massively-supportive-community">Massively supportive community</h5>
<p>So things are happening here, we can see evidence of that. But what
about <em>your</em> idea? What about what <em>you</em> want to see happen around here?</p>
<p>The thing to remember is that most of these communities, locations and
events are started by small groups of people here in Wichita, sometimes
even just one individual.</p>
<p>It takes very little effort to get something going here, and with a
large population of people looking for more things to do, it&#39;s easy to
make yourself known and to draw a crowd.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter <em>who</em> you are in Wichita. <strong>You can make something
happen</strong>, no matter what it is. There exists a community here for your
particular niche, and they are ready and willing (even excited) to
support you in your endeavor. Regardless of the circle, I&#39;ve witnessed
almost zero elitism here. That in itself is incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>Wichita has one of the most supportive communities I&#39;ve ever seen, and
that community just happens to be <strong>packed</strong> with incredibly talented
and creative individuals. Best part of all? They&#39;re all awesome, humble
people, who would gladly sit down, have a beer with you, and offer
whatever advice and support that they can.</p>
<p>That&#39;s something you typically don&#39;t see in larger communities, and a
big part of why I am proud to call Wichita my home town.</p>
<h5 id="be-the-change-you-want-to-see">Be the change you want to see</h5>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard this phrase before. The idea behind it is that
instead of complaining about things that are <em>wrong</em> around you it&#39;s
more effective to set the example and spread the influence that you want
to see around you.</p>
<p>This is advice that I try to follow in my life, all throughout my
interactions with individuals. But in the context of Wichita this
statement is even more powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Wichita is a blank slate, begging to be morphed it something even more
awesome than it already is.</strong></p>
<p>The amazing communities that exist here are nearly all grassroots
efforts that have ended up impacting the community in a positive way.
They&#39;re all supportive of others who are trying to do the same.</p>
<p>Because of this combination just about <em>anyone</em> can make an impact here.
Is there something about Wichita you don&#39;t like? Something you think is
missing? <strong>Then make it happen</strong>. Plenty of other individuals have done
just that. What&#39;s stopping you?</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to make a big splash in much larger communities. Here in
Wichita we are a tight-knit group who all share a common interest in
making our hometown awesome. It&#39;s an incredibly good feeling to do so,
and there is no place on Earth where it&#39;s more possible.</p>
<p>So - stop complaining, and go out there and make something awesome
happen. All it takes is trying, and you&#39;ll see the support of our great
community come out of nowhere to help you along your journey.</p>
<p><strong>That is why I love Wichita. That is why Wichita is awesome.</strong></p>
