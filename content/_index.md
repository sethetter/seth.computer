# Hello! I'm Seth

I am a Wichita, KS based software engineer with a focus on community and
civic tech. I am currently an Engineering Lead at
<a href="https://adhoc.team" title="Ad Hoc">Ad Hoc</a>. I also help
organize the Wichita developers community group,
<a href="https://devict.org" title="devICT">devICT</a>.

I believe technology has the potential to change our world in powerful and
positive ways. It is my goal to help make that happen and to empower
others to do the same.
