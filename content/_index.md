# Hello! I'm Seth

I am a Kansas based software engineer with a focus on community and [civic technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_technology). I am currently an Engineering Lead at <a href="https://adhoc.team" title="Ad Hoc">Ad Hoc</a>. I also founded and help organize organize the Wichita developers community group, <a href="https://devict.org" title="devICT">devICT</a>.

Technology has and continues to shape our world in powerful ways. It is my goal to help bend that change towards the good while inspiring and empowering others to do the same.
