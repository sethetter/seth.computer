title: Let's take a step back
---

I read [an article](http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm)
this morning. It was about the increasing rate at which technology is advancing,
and our visions of the future because of it. I highly recommend you go ahead and
read it. Don't worry, I'll wait.

### My takeaway

* We care way too much about "the next big thing"
* This leads us to disregard current and past technology
* Nothing is ever good enough because it's all about what comes next
* We don't care enough about the non-technical world
* This includes areas of the world that don't have easy access to
computers or the internet.
* The internet was created to connect people and spread
knowledge
* It should be a basic human right to have access to this
powerful tool
* The value of the web is in connecting people and
spreading knowledge. When it is exploited and
controlled by a select few (and for profit), we are at
risk of losing that value.

### The "Next Big Thing"

### The non-technical world

### The value of the web
