title: How I made this site
---

So, this site is made with a system called [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's
a static site generator written in Ruby. It's dead simple to use, and with the
help of GitHub, can be really quick and easy to deploy as well.

On top of all that, you get to write your site content in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)! Can't beat that.

## Getting jekyll

First you need Ruby installed, I don't want to go too far into this but if you
don't have it, I recommend using [rvm](https://rvm.io/).
