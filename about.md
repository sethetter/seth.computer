title: About
---

I am a Wichita, KS based web application developer with a huge focus on
community. I work full time for [The OpenGov Foundation](opengov) and
organize two Wichita community groups, [devICT](devict) and [Open
Wichita](openwichita).

I think technology has the potential to change our world in powerful and
positive ways if used correctly. It's my goal to make that happen and to empower
others to do the same.
