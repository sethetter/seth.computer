# sethetter.com

A repo for my personal website. Completely rewritten on a whim several times over the years, as you do.

## Currently built with

- [Deno](https://deno.land) (lang)
- [Lume](https://lume.land) (SSG)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) (hosting)

## Developing

First [install deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

```
# install dependencies
$ deno task cache

# watch and serve files at `localhost:3000`
$ deno serve
```

## Deployment

Hosted on [netlify](https://netlify.com). Commits to the `main` branch deploy to sethetter.com.
